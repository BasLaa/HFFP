-- data Bool = False | True
-- Bool is type constructor, False and True are data constructors
-- They are nullary constructors
-- This is a sum type

-- types are used in typeclass declarations and signatures
-- they are static and resolve at compile time
-- They are also usd for type aliases: String = [Char]

-- data constructors actually construct values you use at runtime
-- they define a way of building a type

-- Bool is actuÃ lly a type constant as it takes no args
-- similarly, True and False are data constants

-- Kinds are the types to describe types: * -> *
-- a fully applied type is represented as *
